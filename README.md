# React Mini Router

A minimal URL router for [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

Supports HTML5 History and Hash URLs, and requires no special components or markup. Its only
dependencies are [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/component/path-to-regexp) and React.

The goal is to provide a small (both in size and complexity) router that is easy to integrate
into a root level component and makes little to no demands how you structure your application.

## Install

    npm install react-mini-router
    
## Usage

See the [example](./example) app for a complete solution that includes server side rendering 
and integrates with [Fluxxor](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/fluxxor) for Store/Dispatch functionality.
